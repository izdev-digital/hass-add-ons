# izBoard Add-on

**izBoard** displays your Home Assistant dashboards on battery-powered E-Paper devices. Your device automatically fetches updated dashboard images from this add-on on a schedule you control. The add-on converts your Home Assistant dashboards into the right format for E-Paper displays. Because the device only uses power during updates, a single battery charge can last weeks or even months.
